"""Reason codes.

The engine keeps the exact internal code in the decision record and shows officers what
it means and what to check. Customers see a code from the app's reviewed set
(app/lib/reasons.dart), in their language. Fraud, AML and screening reasons are shown
to the customer only as a general review: PMLA forbids tipping off.
