"""Customer letters and the help assistant: model 11 drafts, model 12 translates.

A letter is a fixed template (amounts, rate, Key Facts, legal lines and grievance route
come from the decision, never from the LLM) with three free-text paragraphs the LLM
writes. The help assistant answers from the application's facts and an approved FAQ.
