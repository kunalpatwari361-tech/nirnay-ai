"""Turn an application into the inputs each trained model expects.

Models 1, 2 and 4 were trained on L&T *vehicle* loans, and model 3 on BAF, a synthetic
bank-account fraud set. Nirnay underwrites home loans, so each adapter writes down
how it bridges the gap. None of it is tuned to the demo cases.

- Credit (models 1, 2): bureau inputs mean the same thing for any Indian retail loan and
  go in as they are. Loan amount does not: a Rs 45 lakh home loan is off the vehicle
  scale, so it goes in as missing (0 points). Affordability is judged by FOIR instead.
- Anomaly (model 4): it looks at *combinations*, such as LTV against loan / asset cost.
  The home loan and property value are rescaled to the size of a typical L&T loan
  (AMOUNT_SCALE), which keeps every ratio; the bureau history goes in unchanged.
- Fraud (model 3): inputs we can measure in India are measured (name vs email, OTP-verified
  phone, address and bank-account age, emails on this device, time spent applying).
  The rest take the median of genuine BAF applications (backend/data/fraud_neutral.json),
  so they push the score neither way.
