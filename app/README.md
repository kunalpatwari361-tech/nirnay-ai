# Nirnay customer app (Flutter)

The customer's side of Nirnay: apply for a **Home Loan** or a **Loan Against Property** on the phone and get a decision in minutes, with reasons, in **English and all 22 languages of the Eighth Schedule**. It follows the report's app design (section "One engine, two front doors") and its three demo cases.

**Status:** all screens are built. The app runs on its built-in **sample engine** (`lib/services/mock_api.dart`), or on the **real decision engine** ([backend/](../backend/README.md), all 12 models) through `lib/services/http_api.dart`, behind the same interface (`lib/services/api.dart`). The engine still uses sandbox data sources, so the "Demo mode" banner stays.

## The flow

| Step | Screen | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| – | Welcome | A light home in flat colours. The loan card shows what the customer asked for and the details they gave (name, tenure, property value, income, employer, masked PAN). Only once the loan is approved does it show the approved, or after the final decision the sanctioned, amount with its rate and EMI. **Track your application** on the card opens a timeline from sign-in to disbursement. Also: EMI and eligibility calculators, and (once signed in) the live checks and a Resume card. The language is picked from the button in the header. In demo mode, tap a demo customer to fill in their mobile number. |
| 1 | Sign in | Mobile OTP. The phone gets a random device id, kept on the phone, which the engine binds to the account. |
| 2 | Consent | Plain-language consent for each data pull, plus the DPDP privacy notice (what, why, how long, your rights). Nothing is fetched before this. Each needed consent shows when it was given and when it ends, and has its own options: months of bank statements (6, 12 or 24) and which accounts to share, the KYC method (Aadhaar OTP, DigiLocker or video KYC), using an existing CKYC record, and one more credit check before payout. Optional consents (offers by SMS, email or WhatsApp; loan updates on WhatsApp; an insurance quote) start off. **Manage consents** (here and on the decision screen) switches optional ones off, withdraws a needed one (which stops the application and deletes what was fetched), and shows the consent history. |
| 3 | Your details | Auto-filled from PAN, eKYC and the bank data, then a **quick eligibility check** that updates as you move the sliders. |
| 4 | Live selfie | The front camera runs **inside the app** (no photo app, no gallery). The customer keeps their face in the oval and follows the prompts the engine picked: look straight, then turn left and right (in a random order), about 6 seconds. One frame per step goes to the engine, which checks the head turn, that it's the same face throughout, passive liveness and a 1:1 match with the Aadhaar or PAN photo. If that fails, the customer is offered video KYC. |
| 5 | Documents | Camera or gallery. Each photo is checked **on the phone** for blur, glare and darkness, then the engine reads it: OCR plus the document classifier (model 6). When the engine is connected to DigiLocker, **Get your PAN and e-Aadhaar from DigiLocker** opens DigiLocker instead, and the PAN and Aadhaar cards drop off the list once they're shared. In real mode with no credit bureau connected, an optional **Credit report** card asks for the free report the applicant downloads from CIBIL, Experian, Equifax or CRIF (photo or PDF, less than 3 months old); its score then fills the credit meter. The Account Aggregator card shows only in demo mode. |
| 6 | In-principle decision | Approve, Refer or Reject, the amount and the EMI. Then two **meters** on a 300–900 scale: the **credit score** from the bureau (or, with no bureau connected, from the credit report the applicant uploaded, with a note that an officer confirms it) and the **application score** from our scorecard (model 1) with its grade, coloured by the engine's own cut-offs (below 650 is under our limit, 650–699 goes to an officer, 700–759 is good, 760 and up is excellent). Then the **reasons**, grouped by the outcome: why you got the offer, why it needs a manual check (marked *Pending manual verification*), or why we decided against it, with what went well below. Then the verification score of each document, how the scorecard added up, the Key Facts Statement and a grievance link. Fraud and anti-money-laundering checks are never named to the customer. |
| 7 | Property | Property details and **geo-tagged photos** (front, inside, view), then the final sanction: valuation (model 7) and title checks. |

The consent screen covers:
- the credit bureau check
- 12 months of bank statements through the Account Aggregator
- Aadhaar eKYC and PAN

The quick eligibility check (step 3) follows the report's policy (`lib/policy.dart`):
- **FOIR caps:** 45%, 50% or 60%, by income
- **Home Loan LTV:** RBI's 90%, 80% or 75% tiers
- **LAP LTV:** 60%
- **Rates:** 8.75% for Home Loans, 10.50% for LAP
- **Maximum tenure:** 30 years for Home Loans, 15 for LAP

The Key Facts Statement shows the APR including the fee, and the 3-day cooling-off period.

## The report's three demo cases

The people are fictional. Use OTP **123456**.

| Mobile | Customer | Result |
|---|---|---|
| 98765 00001 | Ravi, 32, salaried: ₹45 lakh Home Loan on a ₹60 lakh flat | **Approved in principle:** ₹45,00,000, EMI ₹39,767 for 20 years at 8.75%. Then **sanctioned** after the property step. Same numbers as the report's worked example. |
| 98765 00002 | Meena, 45, runs a garment shop: ₹60 lakh LAP on a ₹1.2 crore property | **Approved in principle**, then **referred**: "Our lawyer needs to review the property title." |
| 98765 00003 | Arjun, 29, salaried: edited salary slip | **Rejected:** "One of your documents failed verification with the issuing authority." The customer can still ask for a review. |

Every camera step has a **Sample** button, so you can try the whole flow on a laptop.

## Reasons the customer sees

Reasons use the report's reason codes, worded for the customer in both languages (`lib/reasons.dart`). **The code itself (such as `R-FRD-03`) is never shown to the customer**, so a fraud check isn't revealed. Staff see the codes in the portal.

## Run it

You need Flutter 3.47 (stable). On the build PC it's Flutter 3.47.8 at `K:\tools\flutter`, with `K:\tools\flutter\bin` on the PATH.

```bash
cd app
```
```bash
flutter pub get
```
In Chrome:
```bash
flutter run -d chrome
```
On an Android phone (USB debugging on) or the emulator:
```bash
flutter run
```
To build an Android app file:
```bash
flutter build apk --debug
```

### Run it on the real engine

Start the engine first (see [backend/README.md](../backend/README.md)), then:
```bash
flutter run -d chrome --dart-define=NIRNAY_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
```
Without `NIRNAY_API_URL` the app uses the sample engine. With it:
- The consent choices go to the engine before anything is fetched (`PUT /consents`), and later changes in **Manage consents** are sent too.
- The document **Sample** buttons fetch the signed-in person's sandbox documents from the engine, so real OCR and model 6 read real-looking papers. The property **Sample** buttons get a stand-in photo that differs per application, so the reuse check doesn't fire.
- **Do the live selfie with a real face** and turn your head clearly when asked. The demo's sample selfie is a drawing, and the engine's face detector rightly finds no face in it. The live selfie has been tried on Android; in the web build the browser asks for the camera, which hasn't been tried.
- Property photos need their location: allow location in the browser, or the final sanction refers for a valuer visit (`R-PRP-03`).
- The selfie screen shows "Photo match: done when you upload your Aadhaar or PAN card" until the engine has an ID photo with a face. The sandbox's sample cards have no face, so in demos the match stays pending.

On an Android emulator the engine is at `http://10.0.2.2:8000`.

**On a real phone over USB** (tested on a Galaxy Z Flip3, Android 15):
```bash
adb reverse tcp:8000 tcp:8000
```
```bash
flutter build apk --release --dart-define=NIRNAY_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000
```
```bash
adb install -r build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
```
`adb reverse` makes the phone's own `127.0.0.1:8000` reach the engine on the laptop. Android blocks plain `http://`, so `android/app/src/main/res/xml/network_security_config.xml` allows it only for `127.0.0.1`, `localhost` and `10.0.2.2`; every other host still needs HTTPS. Run `adb reverse` again whenever the phone is reconnected.

### Real mode: the APK to share

A real-mode build (`--dart-define=NIRNAY_REAL=true`) is for real applicants. It has no demo people, sample buttons, demo code, demo banner or pre-filled demo address, and the details screen asks the applicant for their own name, date of birth, work, employer, income, EMIs and address. The engine then checks those against the documents, and asks for a bank statement and, at the property step, the sale deed.

- **No credit score question:** the engine pulls the credit report with the PAN when a bureau is connected; without one, the applicant can upload their own report, and an officer confirms it with the bureau before sanction.
- **DigiLocker:** when the engine is connected to DigiLocker, the screen offers **Get my details from DigiLocker**. It opens DigiLocker's sign-in page in a browser tab that closes when sharing is done. The name, date of birth, address, PAN and Aadhaar then come from DigiLocker. Those fields disappear from the form, and the Aadhaar card upload is dropped (the PAN card upload too, once the e-Aadhaar photo gives a face for the selfie match).
- **The link back:** the tab returns to the app through the `nirnay://digilocker` link, registered in `AndroidManifest.xml` for `flutter_web_auth_2`. Build it against the deployed engine ([backend/DEPLOY.md](../backend/DEPLOY.md), step 4):

```bash
flutter build apk --release --dart-define=NIRNAY_API_URL=https://<your-engine> --dart-define=NIRNAY_REAL=true
```

Release builds are signed with the key named in `android/key.properties` (git-ignored; the keystore is in `K:\tools\nirnay-signing\`). Without that file they fall back to the debug key.

**Tests:** 32 tests, run with `flutter test`. Six more run only in a real-mode build: `flutter test test/real_mode_test.dart test/http_api_test.dart --dart-define=NIRNAY_REAL=true` (the full-flow tests use the demo customers, so they're for demo builds only).
- **Policy maths:** the report's worked example to the rupee: ₹45.26 lakh by income, ₹48 lakh by property, EMI ₹39,767, FOIR 49.8%, LTV 75%. Also the FOIR and LTV tiers, and the KFS APR.
- **Photo checks:** blur, glare (but not a white scan background), darkness, and unreadable files.
- **Full flows:** Ravi (approved, then sanctioned), Meena (referred) and Arjun (rejected), tapped through every screen, including the document AI view after each upload. Ravi also shapes a smaller offer, which the final sanction then uses. Plus the EMI calculator, resuming from Home, the switch to Hindi, picking each of the 23 languages (Urdu and Kashmiri switch to right to left), choosing consent options and seeing them in the history, and withdrawing a needed consent from the decision screen.
- **DigiLocker on the documents screen:** the PAN and e-Aadhaar come from DigiLocker and their cards drop off the list; a different PAN in DigiLocker isn't used and the cards stay.
- **Live selfie:** with a stand-in camera, the prompts follow the engine's order, one frame per step goes to the engine in order, the camera closes afterwards, and the head-turn check shows. Without camera access the app says how to allow it.
- **HTTP client:** the engine's JSON for sign-in, consent, profile, selfie (single and live), documents, both decisions and samples, parsed into the app's models; headers and multipart uploads checked; engine errors become `ApiException` codes.

## Languages

English plus the 22 languages of the Eighth Schedule, each named in its own script on the welcome screen and in the language button on every other screen. Flutter's own widgets (date pickers, back-button labels) don't cover Bodo, Dogri, Kashmiri, Konkani, Maithili, Manipuri, Sanskrit, Santali or Sindhi, so those borrow the nearest covered language (`lib/languages.dart`); Kashmiri and Sindhi borrow Urdu, which also makes them right to left. **Only English and Hindi have been reviewed.** The rest need a native speaker's check before launch.

## Files

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `lib/main.dart` | App, routes, languages |
| `lib/theme.dart` | Colours and fonts: flat colours, one navy accent, no gradients |
| `lib/languages.dart` | The 23 languages, their fonts, and the stand-ins for the 9 Flutter doesn't cover |
| `lib/state.dart` | Everything the customer has entered so far |
| `lib/policy.dart` | Eligibility maths (FOIR, LTV tiers, EMI) |
| `lib/services/api.dart` | The calls to the engine; the sample engine and the HTTP client both implement it |
| `lib/services/http_api.dart` | Calls the real decision engine (`--dart-define=NIRNAY_API_URL=...`) |
| `lib/services/mock_api.dart` | Sample engine with the three demo cases |
| `lib/services/image_checks.dart` | On-phone blur, glare and darkness checks (pure Dart) |
| `lib/services/capture.dart` | Camera, gallery, location, and the demo sample images |
| `lib/services/live_camera.dart` | The front camera inside the app for the live selfie (`camera` package, no microphone) |
| `lib/l10n/app_*.arb` | Every string, in each of the 23 languages |
| `assets/fonts/` | Noto fonts for every script (SIL Open Font License, `OFL.txt`) |
| `lib/screens/` | The screens, plus the offer builder (`offer_screen.dart`) and the document AI view (`doc_read_screen.dart`) |
| `test/` | Policy, photo-check and full-flow tests |

**Windows note:** `android/gradle.properties` turns off Kotlin's incremental compiling. Flutter's package cache defaults to C:, and the Kotlin compiler fails when that cache and the project are on different drives. To keep everything on one drive, set the `PUB_CACHE` environment variable to a folder on the project's drive. On the build PC it's `K:\tools\pub-cache`.

## Next steps

- **Real data sources.** The app now talks to the real engine, but the engine's OTP, eKYC, bureau and AA steps are still sandbox stand-ins until licensed sandboxes are in place.
- **Live camera for documents:** a guided document frame with live blur and glare hints (the selfie already uses the `camera` package), and an on-device face check before upload.
- **Payments and signing:** eSign, eNACH or UPI AutoPay, and the KFS PDF.
- **Get the translations checked.** English and Hindi are reviewed; the other 21 were written for this demo and need a native speaker before real customers see them, above all Bodo, Kashmiri, Manipuri (in Bengali script; Meitei Mayek is also official) and Santali (Ol Chiki). Bhashini can cover dynamic text.
